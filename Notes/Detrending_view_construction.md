## View Diagnosis construction

+ Partition into homegenouse
+ Set up test work flow for testing the view construction
  + Divide
  + Total positive and total negative over the whole year.
  + Mean cluster.
    + Large Partition
    + F1, evaluation ...
    + Time and space.
    + Falls alarm, like maximizing precision for 95% recall
    + understanding.....the correlation for all stations.
     (set precision and set recall)
  + Design and experiment views with different.
  + Measure precision at various levels of recall.

 ### Evaluation for multiple bins and combined bins

  + Way to combine iForest score from different bins.
  + Probabilistic views, for different bins/combined bins???
  + $P(S|A(score))=\prod_i^n $
